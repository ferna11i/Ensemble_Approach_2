# Ensemble based approach for multi class image classification

The contents of this repo are as follows:

1. Images folder: contains images of result tables and confusion matrices of some of the experiments

2. Fashion MNIST models (Boruta wrapper).ipynb
This python note book contains most of the code. Here is a list of sections within the notebook.
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model Evaluation functions
3. Training, cross validation and evaluation of base models
4. Testing and training ensemble models on the tuned based models from previous section.
5. Statistical Equivalence test for base learners

4. Fashion MNIST analysis.ipynb
The feature analysis was conducted in this notebook. These are the sections of the notebook.
1. Data preprocessing
2. Boruta Implementation (Wrapper based)
3. Create code for the demo
4. Correlation matrix evaluaton. (Filter based)
5. Mutual Information (Filter based)



5. Demo.ipynb
This notebook is a simple demo code that was executed in the presentation. 
Simply run all cells of the notebook to see the final result.
